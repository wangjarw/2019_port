        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p class="about-para">Identified myself as a visual designer and videographer, I see design as a valuable tool to cultivate connections and empowerment. Coming from a Taiwanese background, I highly value diversity and inclusion. Therefore, many of my projects revolve around the idea of engagement and community. Proficient in utilizing Adobe Suite, specifically for Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, I am in love with visual design, infographics, and illustrations. Furthermore, I also have experience of using After Effects as well as Adobe Premiere for video projects. All these skill sets and the experiences coming with them have assisted me to become a more empathetic and open-minded person who is unafraid of stepping out of my comfort zone.
        </p>
        <p class="about-para">I used to work as a graphic designer co-op in the Royal Bank of Canadaâ€™s Strategy and Communication team. Although not familiar with the banking industry, I took initiatives in attending networking workshops to expand my knowledge. This experience had exposed me to practical projects like venue branding, intranet refreshes, infographics, short videos and other collateral designs. Since I was in a communication role, I left positive impacts on several major cross-functional team projects. The experiences also built out my strong communication and collaboration skills. </p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p class="about-para">I am interested in web design, interaction design and user experience. This website is my first attempt in combining the knowledge I learned from these domains. Recently, I have been trying to explore more in animation and motion graphics to strengthen my visual communication skills.</p>
