    <h2  class="project-section-title first-paragraph first-title">Overview</h2>
    <h3  class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Goal</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph ">Design a event poster for new immigrant family and their children in Frog Hollow Neighbourhood House.</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Time</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph ">3 weeks</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Brief</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">As an immigrant myself, I have strived to engage and assist new immigrants as well as international students. Thus, I volunteered at Frog Hollow Neighbourhood House which had several newcomer assistance programs that constantly hold community activities and events to involve them in the neighbourhood. Within the volunteer team, I mainly worked for their preteen and youth program and I would like to highlight the poster design for main summer community event.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Audience</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">The target audience was mainly preteen and young teenager. I conducted some quick search on what other designers did when they approached this audience base. Being influenced and inspired greatly by Paul Rand, I also did research on his style again to see how he handled elements and arranged them playfully. Afterwards, I started sketching and tested out a vibrant colour scheme for this specific audience. Sketches were then being brought into Illustrator.</p>

    </figure>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Content Structure and Communication</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Tha primary communication method between my coordinator and me was through email. In order to clearly deliver my ideas, I attached design documents with my explanation in emails. This demonstrated that I was able to describe my decision to a lay audience.  </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Moreover, the audience did not spend much time on a poster; however, the information that was assigned was a lot. In order to structure the information concisely,  I discussed with the coordinator the idea of shortening the information. I made an effort in strategizing the content and highlight them with the hierarchy on the poster. </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="image/community_overloaded_info.png" class="project-image" alt="first draft">
      <figCaption>The first draft with too much infomation and low-resolution logos.Since the community centre was near the location that this poster was going to be posted, I suggested removing the address.  </figCaption>
    </figure>

<h2 class="project-section-title">Low-Resolution Image</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Since the event was sponsored by the government, every poster should include several government logos on it. Unfortunately, the image files provided were in jpg file with low-resolution. Thus, it was difficult to clean the image file perfectly even if I removed the background and sharpened the logos. As results, I left white spaces at the bottom of the poster to make the sponsored logo stand out as a solution.</p>


    <h2 class="project-section-title ">Reflection</h2>

    <figure>
      <img src="image/community_final.png" class="project-image" alt="final version">
      <figCaption>A screenshot of the final poster with more negative spaces for the audeince to breathe.</figCaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">In the end, the poster was printed and posted in Anne Hebert Annex School. Because of this poster projectâ€™s success, other community program coordinators had asked me to help with their project promotions, including the career exploration day for the near Van Tech Secondary School. At the end of the year, I was awarded a certificate of recognition from the House of Common.</p>

    <p class="project-paragraph"> Nevertheless, I felt like I should try to compile an image or design folders for the future design volunteers so that they did not struggle over the image archives. I believe if I did this at the time, it could save us more time.</p>
