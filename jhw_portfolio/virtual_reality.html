    <h2 class="project-section-title">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This project was from a course called, <em>Immersive Environment</em>. Students in this class would develop a virtual game for a public community event that promotes VR technology. My team wanted to develop a simple futuristic golfing experience since we thought it would be interesting to surprise our participants’ presumptions towards golfing. By including unexpected game mechanics, we wished to make the participants feel a sense of excitement and fun. </p>

<p class="project-paragraph">Within this project, I was in charge of many roles. Aside from being the environmental modeller, I was also the videographer for our game. To promote our enthusiasm for VR games, we thought of making a game trailer that would highlight our game features. Hence, in this writing, I will focus more on my video production experience (Figure 1).</p>

  <h2 class="project-section-title">Video Direction Under A Tight Deadline</h2>
  <p class="project-paragraph">Near the end of our VR project, our instructor announced we should create video documentation to illustrate our overall game experience with participant feedback from the community event. Our team then decided to create a game trailer that would accurately portray our passion for VR and our game personality. Since we had less than a week to polish our main game components, every team member was working under competing priorities. Hence, I took the initiative and gathered our programmers and artists to quickly brainstorm on what they think should be included in the video.</p>

  <p class="project-paragraph">This decision-making process was difficult because our artists and programmers valued different game aspects. After numerous discussions, I suggested the team to list out the uniqueness of our game that would engage and attract our participants. With the help from our instructor, we eventually all agreed on showcasing our smooth game physics, mechanics and interactions.</p>

  <h2 class="project-section-title">Project Management</h2>
  <p class="project-paragraph">Because the school computer could not install any external recording software, my team had to rely on their home desktops to record in-game footage. I asked our programmers to record the play-through since they knew how to set up the VR platform efficiently. To prevent our programmers from forgetting what to record, I provided a checklist for them and also maintained constant communications with them.</p>

  <h2 class="project-section-title">Challenge of Filming and Organizing Alone in the Community Event</h2>
  <p class="project-paragraph">
    Like how I have mentioned previously, running a VR game requires a high degree of concentration and maintenance. Each team member during the community showcase was occupied by multiple tasks at the same time; this also meant I had to capture all the guest player’s interaction footage alone. Since I was the only person interacting with our participants, I was also in charge of managing the crowd during the showcase.</p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">To ensure the team could capture participant footage that would assist us in promoting our game to the community, I drafted a simple shot list and storyboards before the community event to minimize filming unpredictability. A question list was also created to help prompt the guest players to articulate their feedback. Furthermore, I also created a location planning diagram(Figure 2) for the showcase that would allow me to follow and film our guest players without disrupting their game experiences (Figure 3). Overall, our participants were very satisfied.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Video Editing</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">After the community showcase, I collected and reviewed all the participant footage and in-game recording. To create an engaging game trailer, I started organizing the video content and planned out the editing style with my shot list and storyboards. Adobe Premiere and After Effects were used for editing and post production (Figure 4). Due to the limited amount of footage and time, I decided to insert participant feedback clips in between the in-game recording; by doing this, it helped highlight the possibilities and fun that our game had.</p>
    <p class="project-paragraph">One important editing technique that potentially attracted the curiosity of the community was how our viewers were situated in the physical world where the community showcase was; the sudden jump cut into the imaginary world then could consequently bring out viewers’ excitement and curiosity. Lastly, I used the fade-out technique to transition the viewers back into our real world; user feedback intertwined with the intriguing game dynamics allowed our viewers to connect with actual people. This editing style then was able to invite more people into the VR world.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Reflection</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Our VR community showcase was broadcasted on <a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=1373354">CBC News</a> and our trailer was eventually being updated onto our team website. Through this experience, I learned time management, communication and pre-production were so important to achieve quality work. Especially working under a tight deadline with competing priorities, this project had strengthened my project management skills and organization skills. If I had more time, I would make sure to include more footage of the game environment to show our viewers different sides of our game. Figure 5 is a photo of my team and me after the community event. </p>
