    <h2 class="project-section-title">Brief</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This project was from a course called, <em>Immersive Environment</em>. Students in this class would develop a virtual game for a public community event that promotes VR technology. My team wanted to develop a simple futuristic golfing experience since we thought it would be interesting to surprise our participantsâ€™ presumptions towards golfing. By including unexpected game mechanics, we wished to make the participants feel a sense of excitement and fun. </p>

    </figure> -->


    <p class="project-paragraph">Within this project, I was in charge of many roles. Aside from being the environmental modeller, I was also the videographer for our game. To promote our enthusiasm for VR games, we thought of making a game trailer that would highlight our game features. Hence, in this writing, I will focus more on my video production experience (Figure 1).</p>

<h2 class="project-section-title">Communication</h2>
<p class="project-paragraph">At almost the end of the project, there were only 5 days left for us to film a VR game trailer that demonstrated the overall experience.   I led a team discussion to discuss with the programmers on what features would be essential that had to be showcased.  They considered it would be the best if the trailer could focus on the game mechanics and dynamics since our game focused on smooth physics. In order to decrease the unpredictability and being able to film quickly, I outlined a simplified version of a shot list and a storyboard for myself.
</p>

<h2 class="project-section-title">Challenge of Time Constraints</h2>
<p class="project-paragraph">However, due to the fact that the school computer that was powerful enough to run the VR game could not install any external recording software, my team had to rely on home desktops to record in-game footage. I asked our programmers to record the play-through since they knew how to set up the unity project efficiently. Meaningful communication was so important at this stage due to the time constraint. </p>

<h2 class="project-section-title">Challenge of Filming Alone</h2>
<p class="project-paragraph">
  Furthermore, I wanted to feature guest player footage in the trailer. Hence, the final showcase was included. The challenge was that every team member was occupied by other tasks and this meant that only I was able to film. It was difficult to manage everything at the same time with the presence of our guest players. Therefore, in order to manage the chaos, I planned out filming prior to the showcase so it went smoothly during the event.</p>

  <p class="project-paragraph">In the end, I used Premiere and After Effects to edit the trailer by following the preproduction outline I created. The trailer was embedded in our team website and our VR experience was also being introduced on <a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=1373354">CBC news</a> to promote VR applications. Through this experience, I learnt that time management, communication and pre-production were so important to achieve quality work. </p>
