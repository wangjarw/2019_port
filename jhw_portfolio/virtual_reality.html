    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Goal</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph">Developing a game VR game trailer that showcase the feature of the VR game.</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Teammates</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph">Tamiko Tadeo, Kenny Cheung and Liah Castillo</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Time</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph">5 days</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Brief</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This project was assigned in the course, <em>Immersive Environment</em> in which the student had to develop a virtual experience using the VR platform for the audience to feel a sense of high presence and engagement. Within this specific game project, one of my main roles was the videographer so that our VR experience can be documented for promoting VR technology.

    <p class="project-paragraph">After our ideation stage, my team wanted to create a golfing experience with the focus on having a futuristic but beautifully made environment so that players can be more engaged with the experience. And I volunteered to do the trailer portion that would help to highlight the major game mechanics and features.</p>

  <!-- <p class="project-paragraph"> After our ideation stage, my team wanted to create a golfing experience with the focus of having futuristic but beautifully made environment so that players can be more engaged with the experience. Instead of having to chase after the golf ball being hit, our programmers, Tamiko and Kenny thought it might be interesting to incorporate a teleportation mechanic for players to move around. This decision further minimized the chance of motion sickness of players. Nevertheless, our game strived to have a realistic physics, we conducted playtesting with the users. I made a rough draft of user testing questions and filmed the playtesting process to document the result. Through the process, my team found that due to the controllerâ€™s constraint, our players found it hard to map the controller to the real life golfing movement. Hence, I created a tutorial terrain in Unity with basic game mechanics features including teleportation, golf club respawn point and a camera playing the path of the golf ball. Lastly, I was also in charge of modelling some of the in game components in maya  including breakable crystal/rocks, cave and golf camera and looking for suitable pre-made models for the players to involve in the game.</p> -->

<h2 class="project-section-title">Communication</h2>
<p class="project-paragraph">At almost the end of the project, there were only 5 days left for us to film a VR game trailer that demonstrated the overall experience.   I led a team discussion to discuss with the programmers on what features would be essential that had to be showcased.  They considered it would be the best if the trailer could focus on the game mechanics and dynamics since our game focused on smooth physics. In order to decrease the unpredictability and being able to film quickly, I outlined a simplified version of a shot list and a storyboard for myself.
</p>

<h2 class="project-section-title">Challenge of Time Constraints</h2>
<p class="project-paragraph">However, due to the fact that the school computer that was powerful enough to run the VR game could not install any external recording software, my team had to rely on home desktops to record in-game footage. I asked our programmers to record the play-through since they knew how to set up the unity project efficiently. Meaningful communication was so important at this stage due to the time constraint. </p>

<h2 class="project-section-title">Challenge of Filming Alone</h2>
<p class="project-paragraph">
  Furthermore, I wanted to feature guest player footage in the trailer. Hence, the final showcase was included. The challenge was that every team member was occupied by other tasks and this meant that only I was able to film. It was difficult to manage everything at the same time with the presence of our guest players. Therefore, in order to manage the chaos, I planned out filming prior to the showcase so it went smoothly during the event.</p>

  <p class="project-paragraph">In the end, I used Premiere and After Effects to edit the trailer by following the preproduction outline I created. The trailer was embedded in our team website and our VR experience was also being introduced on <a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=1373354">CBC news</a> to promote VR applications. Through this experience, I learnt that time management, communication and pre-production were so important to achieve quality work. </p>
