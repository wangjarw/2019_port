    <h3  class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Goal</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph "> Refresh the current site to promote the Strategy and Transformation team and make the site user-friendly.</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Teammates</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph ">Mainly an individual co-op project but several RBC UX designers helped me throughout the iteration process.</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Tools</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph ">Adobe Illustrator, HTML, CSS, JIVE</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Time</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph ">4 month</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Brief</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This website refresh is one of the major projects I worked on during my co-op term in RBCâ€™s Strategy and Communications Team, which is a part of the Strategy and Transformations Team. The previous site was a rigid tile-based website with many outdated documents displayed on the page. Hence, my direct supervisor decided to take action to make the website more current and user-friendly. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Without having many real-world UX/ UI experiences, I volunteered to work on this website which would eventually be used by everyone in the Strategy and Transformations Team. This was my first UX/UI centred project that helped me build out skills in information architecture, web design and problem-solving skills. Adobe Illustrator was used in creating banners, icons and mockups.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">First attempt of doing UX/ UI</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Due to the lack of UX/UI and information architecture knowledge, I encountered many challenges in doing wireframes. Not knowing how to determine information hierarchy and the design style, my first few attempts in creating wireframes became chaotic and meaningless. At this stage, the initial drafts lacked cohesion and flow. Since no one from my team had UX/ UI backgrounds, I struggled in grouping each piece of information (Figure 1).</p>
