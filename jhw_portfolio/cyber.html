    <h2  class="project-section-title first-paragraph first-title">Overview</h2>
    <h3  class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Goal</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph ">Create an educational brochure about cybersecurity for RBC's student tech event in British Columbia.</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Teammates</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph ">Kirkland McNeill </p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Time</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph ">3 weeks</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Brief</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">Working in the Strategy and Communications Team as a graphic designer co-op, my job was to promote and showcase technological achievements as well as information through the use of infographics and illustrations. Kirkland McNeill was the other designer co-op that I worked with during my co-op term. </p>
    <p class="project-paragraph">The project was one of the major cross-team collaborations. RBC’s cybersecurity awareness team reached out to us and wished we could assist them in designing educational cybersecurity brochures for their upcoming student event in British Columbia. In order to promote RBC’s innovative technological side and their belief in supporting the future generation, being able to deliver an informative and friendly brochure for the students became crucial.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Tight timeline</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">This project demonstrated my ability to rapidly move through the design process under a tight deadline. Being able to effectively brainstorm, iterate and organize the brochure content as well as design was extremely important because the final design was going to be printed out for an external audience. Every design decision had to be approved by other departments to ensure it adheres to the company’s image. Hence, efficient team dynamics and communication skills between my co-op colleague, Kirkland and I became exceptionally critical.</p>
    <p class="project-paragraph">According to the guidelines, the drafts had to be sent to our supervisor and the cybersecurity team to ensure the style matches the cybersecurity team’s image. Afterward, the designs had to be sent to the corporate branding team to make sure our designs follow the company guidelines. This reviewing process tended to consume the most time (figure 1). Moreover, the feedback between teams also differed from the initial request. Thus, to ensure each iteration was on-brand and free from error, I broke down the texts we received from the cybersecurity team. Kirkland was then in charge of making the security checklist engaging; whereas I was in charge of designing security habits information in a clean and modern style.</p>


    <h2 class="project-section-title">Time Management and Branding Challenges</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">To make sure we offer the cybersecurity team with diverse design options, Kirkland and I brainstormed together to visualize all the possible styles that represented the cybersecurity team’s engaging personality. I then proposed several designs with flat icons and human photographs portraying their friendliness and client-focused vision (figure 2). After being reviewed by the cybersecurity team, we received more brochure information and then the first draft was also sent to the corporate branding team for reviews. The design style and the format consequently evolved into the second draft (figure 2).</p>

      <figCaption>Figure 2: An overview of the drafts that I submitted for branding reviews.</figCaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">One of the major challenges I faced during the design process was the amount of the content not able to fit into a double-sided brochure. Although we had grouped the information, there were still too many texts. To achieve an effective team collaboration and a seamless communicative process, I voluntarily initiated regular design meetings with the cybersecurity team for quick amendments. This action allowed both sides to give immediate feedback which increased the overall efficiency.</p>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Moreover, RBC at the time was refreshing their company branding. Consequently, there were many unfinalized design guidelines. Kirkland and I struggled with this ambiguity but still tried our best to deliver the brochures on time. Nevertheless, I was able to constantly discuss with my supervisors and the cybersecurity team to minimize inaccurate branding decisions. I also tried to dig out RBC’s past design booklet to aim for a precise and appropriate corporate personality.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title ">Reflection</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">In the end, the cybersecurity student event in British Columbia was successful, and the cybersecurity team was very pleased by the outcome (figure 3). From this project, I was able to understand how it felt like to work within a big corporation and create something impactful. It took me a while to comprehend the intention of carefully reviewing the design. </p>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Because of this unique opportunity, I learned the importance of delivering an accurate corporate image via design, especially when the company was attempting something new. Thus, how designers build up the company image in the tech community becomes extremely crucial. I am glad I was able to recognize the hidden message behind all the iterations. This project indeed taught me how to cautiously work with the company goal in mind. </p>
