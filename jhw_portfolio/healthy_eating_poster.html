  <section>
    <h2  class="project-section-title first-paragraph first-title">Overview</h2>
    <h3  class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Goal</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph "> design a health related poster using assigned design style.</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Teammates</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph ">Annette Cheung and Liam Flemming</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Time</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph ">1 month</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Brief</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This project was an academic project from the course <em>Graphic Design</em>. Health had been a crucial topic. Hence, it was assigned as the main design domain. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Since this course was an introductory graphic design course, in order to help us learn the basic design knowledge, we were asked to do research on design styles in different eras. In the end, my team was assigned to research Paul Rand -- the iconic designer from New York School style. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Research and Observation</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Before doing research, the team first decided to focus on the topic of healthy eating since this topic was more relevant to the student community. Afterwards, each of us decided to do individual research and observation on Paul Rand’s style.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="image/healthy_eating_research.png" class="project-image" alt="observation of Paul Rand's works">
      <figCaption>This is a synthesis of our observations on Paul Rand's style.</figCaption>
    </figure>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Learning New Tool</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Nevertheless, this was my first time using Illustrator. I only had experiences in using Photoshop for digital painting. Nonetheless, in order to achieve mimic Paul Rand's style-- colourful and sharp shape collages, I spent one afternoon to self-learnt Illustrator with assistance from Photoshop. </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="image/healthy_eating_sketch.png" class="project-image" alt="some sketches for the poster">
      <figCaption>A photo of the sketches.</figCaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">I then started brainstorming and brought the sketches into Illustrator. After each of us designing a draft, we brought the posters together and examine which one could be brought forward. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Challenge in Merging Ideas</h2>

    <figure>
      <img src="image/healthy_eating_3design.png" class="project-image" alt="each team meber's designs">
      <figCaption>My poster was the pink one with the diagonal fork directing the audience's attention to the message. </figCaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Each of us had different interpretations on how to implement the style. This situation led to a problem where it was hard to decide which poster could be carried on. I took on the leadership and invited other students to vote on our posters and my poster was chosen because people saw the potentials and the colour contrast was similar to Paul Rand which made it memorable. </p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">Although my poster was chosen, I was willing to incorporate my teammates’ interpretation of the style into my design. This incorporation included toning down the colour contrast and using yellow to lighten the mood.</p>


    <h2 class="project-section-title ">Reflection</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">In the end, the project was successful and it actually has influenced my design preference. It helped me to build the design skills and learn to study from the best examples before ideating.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="image/healthy_eating_final.png" class="project-image" alt="final versions">
      <figCaption>Left one was our final poster with less colour contrast and focusing on irregular organic shapes. Nevertheless, I am still so passionate about this project, the right one was refined again by me in my free time.</figCaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Additionally, this project also taught me how to create a more inclusive team. One of my teammates, Liam was not a very talkative person. This project gave me the chance to discover different ways to approach and encourage this type of teammate.</p>
