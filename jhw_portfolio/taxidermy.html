    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Goal</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph">To make a 3-4 minute documentary-style video about the value of taxidermy for <em>The Wild Things</em> exhibition in the Museum of Vancouver.</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Teammates</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph">Justine Zhang, Tamiko Tadeo</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Time</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph"> 2 weeks</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Brief</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This was a school project for IAT 344, “Moving Images” where students were assigned to collaborate with real world clients and help them produce documentaries. Our group chose to work with the Museum of Vancouver. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph"><em>The Wild Things</em> is on display starting summer, 2018 to 2020 and it illustrates the positive relationship between human, technology and nature. After listening to the museum’s proposed concept, my team were interested in the opportunity to document the historical and cultural relationships between human and nature. Thus, we decided to film a documentary project on this topic. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Pre-production</h2>

    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Different from a scripted film, making a documentary requires a lot more planning due to the unpredictability of the filming location and content. Hence, a museum location visit was scheduled. Before visiting the museum, I led my team to brainstorm to prepare a set of mood boards, possible documentary composition, pre-production questions and colour palettes that could prepare us to envision the story messages and goals.</p>


    <p class="project-paragraph">After visiting the museum and meeting with the museum curator, Viviane Gosslin, we were assigned taxidermy as a topic. Thus, my team refined the filming direction towards capturing the positive relationship between human and taxidermy. I led the group again in creating guiding questions and doing storyboarding for our upcoming interviews. By doing this, it helped my team to understand how we could set up the equipment quickly and film the subjects with purposes. At this stage, my team developed an overall message of an introduction to taxidermy and its values.</p>

    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Since we had visited the museum before, we were able to know what kinds of equipment that we should bring to their dim and tight artifact storage room. In order to light the environment, I reminded the team to bring portable  LED lights and reflector to improve the unideal filming location. Moreover, I also led the team to review what each member should do at the filming site before filming.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Filming and Challenges</h2>
    <figure class="big-project-img">
      <img src="image/taxidermyTL-03.png" class="project-image" alt="production timeline">
      <figCaption>The second half of the production timeline.</figCaption>

    <figure class=" small-project-img">
      <img src="image/taxidermyTL-04.png" class="project-image" alt="production timeline">
      <figCaption>The second half of the production timeline.</figCaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">After filming the interviews at Museum of Vancouver, my team quickly teased out the footage and polished the audio that could be used. I helped the team to reduce noises in the audio and edited the rough cut using Adobe Audition and Adobe Premiere.  Colour-correction was also finished by myself using Adobe After Effects. </p>

    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Nevertheless, we faced the biggest challenge: not knowing how to tease out the main documentary idea based on the limited amount of the interviews.  By referring back to the pre-production package, Justine and I then worked together to refine the content and me further on compiling a list of keywords that could be used in future filming. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Reflection</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">My team went back to the museum to film for the second time. We filmed smoothly with the previous preparation. The first screening of the documentary was played in School of Interactive Art and Technology Festival in Yaletown Roundhouse community center. It is played in the museum for the exhibition now till 2020. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">What I have learnt from the project is the importance of pre-production preparation since it is very crucial for my team to respond quickly according to the unpredictable circumstances that might happen during shooting and editing. Unpredictability indeed gave my team a lot of stress. After this project, I had learnt to be more flexible and understanding when facing technical issues, scheduling issues and team conflicts. </p>
