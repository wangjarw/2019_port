    <h2 class="project-section-title">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This project was from the course, <em>Moving Image</em>, where students were assigned to collaborate with real clients to produce community documentaries. My team collaborated with the Museum of Vancouver for their <em> Wild Things </em> exhibition. The exhibition focused on illustrating the positive relationships between humans, technology and nature. My team thought the intention of educating the community on this environment-related topic was meaningful. Hence, that was why we decided to produce a documentary about taxidermies to illustrate the profound historical and cultural relationships. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Pre-Production Planning</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Different from a scripted film, making a documentary requires more planning. This filming experience demonstrated how I applied and developed my project management skills. Before visiting the museum to preview our subject – the taxidermy collection, it was important to frame and plan for our topic. Since we did not know the filming location, lighting condition and the number of specimens we would cover, I suggested my team to brainstorm before our museum tour (Figure 1). This preproduction process including producing a set of mood boards and conceptual questions, helped us envision the central messages and goals. By bringing physical brainstorming materials to meet with the museum curator, Viviane Gosslin, my team was able to reiterate our documentary direction toward educating and informing the public; our outlines also helped the curator to refocus the exhibition content and atmosphere. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Nevertheless, because we only had two filming opportunities with the museum, organizational and planning skills became exceptionally crucial. After the museum visit, I guided my team to further create an in-depth question list, possible storyboards and equipment plans for our future filming and interviews (Figure 2 & Figure 3). By doing this, it trained my team to be able to set up the equipment quickly and transition between the subjects more precisely.</p>

    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Moreover, this planning process also prepared us to film flexibly using various equipment. Since the filming location was their basement storage room, lighting kit, extra portable LED lights and reflectors were noted down in the planning checklist to improve the unideal filming location (Figure 4). A glide cam and a camera grip were also brought along with us to provide us with more ways to achieve fluid tracking shots.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Filming Challenges</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">The reason why documentaries are more difficult to film is the message of the film could change drastically. We were unable to predict precisely who the interviewees were and what they were going to say. This made it challenging for us to capture footage that aligned with our preplanned theme. Therefore, not knowing how to sort out the raw footage into one cohesive idea was our biggest challenge after our first shoot. My teammate, Justine and I worked more closely together to refine the content. I further compiled a list of keywords that could help us focus during our second filming visit. Since we recognized what was lacking from the previous filming, the team was able to interact more attentively with the interviewees and to collect more B-rolls and artifacts from the surroundings (Figure 5). </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">After filming the interviews at the Museum of Vancouver, my team quickly organized the footage and polished the audio that could be used. I did noise reduction using Adobe Audition and editing in Adobe Premiere. Colour-correction was also adjusted using Adobe After Effects (Figure 6).</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Reflection</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">The first screening of the documentary was played in the School of Interactive Art and Technology Festival in the Yaletown Roundhouse community center. It was then incorporated into the Wild Things exhibition from June 28, 2018, to January 12, 2020 (Figure 7). Our documentary video becomes their feature video on their <a href="https://museumofvancouver.ca/wild-things" class="paragraph-in-text">main website</a>. In 2019, BC Museums Association also recognized the exhibition’s efforts in promoting environmental education. I feel very honoured to be a part of this production. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">What I have learned from the project is the importance of pre-production preparation since my team needed to respond quickly during the filming and editing process. Unpredictability indeed gave my team much stress but because of our preparation, we were able to leave a trustful image to the museum. After this project, I had learned to be more flexible and understanding when facing technical issues and scheduling conflicts.</p>
